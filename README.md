# Simple Coding Evaluation

The program is developed using node.js. It is taking two input files names.txt and list.txt and searching the names in list.txt file and providing output in the below format

NameFromFile: linenumber1, linenumber2 ..

There are two sample test files namely list-testFile.txt and names-testFile.txt, in case someone needs to run with smaller data sets. One needs to change test.js file to run the program with these smaller sets.
